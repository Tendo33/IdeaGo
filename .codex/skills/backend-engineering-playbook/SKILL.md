# Backend Engineering Playbook

This legacy skill is a thin Trellis pointer.

Read `.trellis/spec/backend/index.md` and `.trellis/spec/shared/verification.md`
before backend work. Keep FastAPI handlers thin, report contracts typed, hosted
ownership checks fail-closed, and secrets out of logs and browser-visible
configuration.
